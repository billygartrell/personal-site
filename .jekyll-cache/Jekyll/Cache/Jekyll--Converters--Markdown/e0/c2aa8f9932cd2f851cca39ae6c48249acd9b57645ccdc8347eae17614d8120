I"Ì<p>Wow, very exciting. Iâ€™ve got my first Jekyll post.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve wanted to re-create a blog for a few years now. Back in 2017, I had written in my blog every day, sharing some creative thing that I had completed that day. Daily posts became a little bit too challenging to maintain over time.</p>

<p>But, I do love the idea of owning my own little piece of the internet that is full of my thoughts and things that I loveâ€“ an archive of who I am over time.</p>

<p>Today has been a lot of exploring what Jekyll offers and learning how to edit the pages. Iâ€™ve never used a static blog generator like this before, so itâ€™s taking some time to understand, but Iâ€™m pleased that itâ€™s up and running.Ã§</p>
