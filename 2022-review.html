      <div class="introduction">
        <h2>An Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, hello. Welcome to this little website. I hope you had a good year.<br><br>
          2022 was really special for me. It felt like the first year in my adult life where I really felt in control of myself. One where I felt fully like "me". A big contributor to that new mindset, I think,  was keeping track of all of the stuff I did this year. On a whim in January, I started to write down everything I was doing  in a note. Somehow, I managed to do it all year long. This website is a collection of those notes and ratings. I thought it’d be fun to share.

        <h2>Why Track?</h2>
        <p>There are a few things I wanted to get out of the note on my phone:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>To understand what I like and dislike.</li>
          <li>To remember my life and my experiences better.</li>
          <li>To be persistent and only track things that I’ve seen through to completion.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I want to know the things I like and why I like them. I want to be able to tell you my favorite food, color, and movie at any time. And honestly, I want to stop wasting my time with things that I don’t really enjoy.<br><br>
          I want to better remember what tastes amazing, what I did with friends, and how I felt when first listening to a song or watching a movie.<br><br>
          I never complete things. I have so many books lying around half-finished. So I made a rule that I could only add something to this list if I completed it. I really made it a priority this year to finish something before I start something new.<br><br>
          Alright, let's get into it.

          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>This year I’ve been searching for this feeling that my friend Jevins described as the "aesthetic experience". It’s when you consume some kind of art and feel your entire brain light up. The world feels brighter, sounds feel sharper. It’s something that I only feel a few times a year and I'm prying my eyes to try and see it as often as possible. Everything Everywhere All At Once did that for me. My life felt different after watching that movie. Funny, emotional, visually unique.<br><br>
          I think I always knew this, but I love art that directly combines visual flair with a unique soundtrack. Even my favorite records have to have album covers that fully connect to the experience of the music. I can't get away from that combo.<br><br>
          I want to dive into the deeper catalog of the directors and teams that worked on my favorite movies from this year. So in 2023, I want to dive into the works of Danny Boyle, David Fincher, Mike Mills, etc.</p>

              Really gripping performance by Carey Mulligan. Very unsettling and kept me unsure of what was going to happen next. Did not expect <span class="spoiler-red">her death at the end</span>. Really points out at so many levels how women are preyed upon. That is what’s the most sinister about this movie.

              This movie is not good. Sorely lacking the best part of the series: The Hobbit. Martin Freeman shines in every scene but all other characters in this movie are so shallow. Fight scenes are uninteresting and too long. CGI is so blatant and awkward. Truly nothing interesting happens in this whole film. Makes me know I’d never want to watch this trilogy again.

Long but so packed with world-building and intrigue. This has solidified as one of my favorite movies ever. Sweet moments. Serious moments. Sad moments. It has it all.

              I find the first half of this one is a drag. Sméagol is quite annoying early on. All of the new Rohan characters are not very compelling and are challenging to keep track of. However, it definitely picks up in the second half. It’s such an important movie for filling in all gaps through flashbacks, etc. Helms Deep is fun. The Ents are fun. Overall, still enjoyable.

              Continues to be one of the most moving pieces of art that I’ve ever seen. So many quotable moments. So much humor. So much sadness. “Now is the envy of all of the dead” gives me chills still. I’m so glad that I still love it. I don’t know. I want to have more of an analysis but for right now, that’s all that I have.

Some plots feel less important and lack as much weight as others. But overall it’s absolutely enjoyable and a fun film.

              Nothing crazy. I love triangle land very much. This one focused more on the idea of clones and how perpetual cloning maybe isn’t a great idea all the time. Dwelling on the past. Being a tourist of your past life to a problematic level. The future’s visuals were very beautiful; much more than the first movie, but I found the story to be less interesting.

              That was truly interesting. So much more complex than both the first and second episodes. A murder mystery, commentary about obsessing over potential pasts and potential futures, the complexities of time and how little we really know about it. I feel a lot. I don’t feel the same deep depressive connection that I once did to the first episode of this series but I am entertained and feel moved by it regardless. That was very entertaining. I’m looking forward to watching it again some day.

The last two longer stories were a little too complicated for my liking. The pace is very fast and if you don’t catch every word it becomes challenging to watch. However, the best part of the film was <span class="spoiler-red">the renowed chef describing a poison as beautiful new flavor he had never had before.</span> Average film. Incredible, incredible visual presentation. It’s not enough to save it, though.

Colors feel brighter, I hear the soft sounds around me that are usually masked by my own narrow mind. I feel my body. It’s gotta be the closest to enlightenment that I’ve gotten in this human form. This movie did that for me. Total absurdity, hilarity, passion.

The little earpiece in the movie feels like a common thing already. AI still feels a few more years out but the futuristic look and fashion is pretty on-trend with today. Strange. Anyway, this is still a fun weird little movie that presents some interesting ideas about self discovery & relationships. It’s challenging but ultimately rewarding watching Todd come to terms with his life and his ability to move on. Great soundtrack as well. Very touching piano pieces and a wonderful performance by Joaquin. I don’t love this movie as I once did. This was a film where I felt buzzed after leaving the theatre. It was very important to me at one time and will remain to be in some form or another, I’m sure.

              I’m giving this a five because I was on the verge of tears twice and it made me appreciate my life. That’s it, right? The cast was incredible. All of the characters were perfect in their roles. The use of interviews made this movie feel like it was switching between fiction and non-fiction. It was a really interesting technique. The sound design was really fantastic as well. Really high attention to detail and beautiful music. There were so many thought provoking moments from the lens of both childhood and adulthood. I think I’m at the right place in my life to watch this and feel its impact. But I could see it changing entirely after having children. Yeah, this was good. One of the children interviewed described the afterlife as a big field with one tree in it. You lay amongst the flowers and just enjoy your time there in the soft rays of the sun. That got me. That got me.

              The subject matter is actually incredibly cool. The documentary is just kind of boring. Scientists doing unsexy science stuff but making groundbreaking discoveries. It had moments of cool inspiration. And some motion graphics that were kind of interesting. I want to know more about space.

              My parents put this on for us. It was honestly quite enjoyable. I haven’t seen a silly, lighthearted movie like this in a really, really long time and I totally enjoyed it. Reminder that every once in a while you just need a fun time. The CGI was the worst I think I’ve ever seen in a film but the characters were fun. Woody and Kevin were good. A big ol’ NOT BAD.

              Much better the second time around and with reading the book. I can at least appreciate it more. The visuals are really stunning. The CG work is convincing and it’s an interesting world to sit in for a little while. Overall though, it’s so complicated and the characters are not compelling. OTHER than Stellan Skarsgard. He is so creepy and wonderful.

Eminem just isn’t a good actor. Also his character isn’t very likable. The best scene is when <span class="spoiler-red">he fights this dude in the recording studio while a radio show is being filmed</span>. Great shot compositionally. The rest: eh, not so much.

              I love this movie and I’m glad that it’s still enjoyable. The first act of the movie feels stale these days. Zombies have been incredibly played out since this film came out and the intro is always the same. It’s unforunate, because at the time this felt unique. The second and third acts are fantastic. The cinematography is still amazing. Artfully done. The score is so good. Builds tension in such a wonderful way. The characters feel like they are actually friends. I’m so happy I got to see it in theaters and it was such a joy to experience again.

          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>My default mode of relaxation is sitting on the couch and watching TV. I feel like it has been for us all culturally, right? I mean, the phrase "Netflix and Chill" has been tossed around endlessly for a while now. Anyway, I'd like to do a little LESS Netflix next year. I definitely watched a lot of really wonderful shows and when they're great, I can't get away from them. That's kind of the issue though. I'd much rather read, play a video game, or even watch a movie than watch 10 hours of content in my free time to finish a series in a few days. It has its place in my life for sure, but now that I've experimented with so many other hobbies this year, I know that I can work them all into my life. And that feels really good for me right now.</p>

              Half star for everyone being young hot and messy. I’ll admit that I cannot look away from them. 3 starts strictly for Zendaya’s performance in the episode where <span class="spoiler-pink">she freaks out on drugs and the whole charade is finally broken</span>. Incredible episode of television as a stand-alone. Incredibly powerful and real performance. The rest of the season isn’t great. The characters don’t feel real. Their motivations are all over the place. The storytelling and often fourth-wall breaking setup is quite great and clever, but often doesn’t tell compelling enough stories about its characters.

              Wow. A really stunning portrayal of someone who is so talented who has grown into a truly challenging figure. The early tapes are incredible to watch. By a stroke of luck, Coodie captured all of, and still has, these pivotal moments for Kanye early on. His drive and talent is totally apparent. That incredible footage in contrast with his later rambling, incoherent, and difficult conversations is hard to watch. It’s rough but wholly thorough and human. I could have watched 5 more episodes of this. Additionally, the telling of Coodie’s story throughout was touching as well. Really well done. Update: Crazy to see how even further Kanye has fallen this year. Terrible.

It picks up toward the end and as always there are some truly fun bits of quick dialog. But overall it suffers from pacing and it doesn’t really feel like the characters grow in significant ways this season.

It’s really truly good. I was so excited to watch every episode this time around and almost every one paid off. I wish more shows were this short with this much quality. One of the best things I’ve seen this year for sure. FLCL is the only other anime that comes close to this.

It doesn’t really feel like anything is happening to characters in a meaningful way. It feels shallow and silly. The dwarves are pretty good. I don’t hate the Harfoot story. I just wish it was all less complicated. I think it’d benefit from a simpler story.

Interesting drama from family character motivations. Feels overly complex for me as well. Also there are so many insanely gruesome birth scenes in this show for some reason.

          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Reading is kind of amazing, huh? This is the most I've read in a year since I was a child and I'm loving it. I love language. I love METAPHORS. SYMBOLS.<br><br>
            To me, reading feels like a more active form of consuming art. Or at least that's what I want reading to be. I can't read in the background. I have to be focusing on it to be able to consume it properly and I really love that. I want to be fully consumed by art more often and reading is a simple way to do so, I think.<br><br>
            I owe my renewed love for reading to Laura who has be ripping through books this year. Seeing her get through so many was a good motivator to read myself and I'm so thankful for it.<br><br>
          Klara and the Sun struck me in a way that I did not expect. Something about it touched me so deeply. That book really opened the door for more literary fiction in my life. That's my big recommendation for the year.</p>

                Truly fascinating. A book exploring the history of trauma research from one of the best researchers and scientists in the field. Remarkable seeing how it has progressed, how much we have learned, and how much we still have to learn. It shows how many options there truly are to getting back in touch with one’s body and it's quite amazing. I gained a lot of practical advice for my own life as well.

                This took me a really long time to finish. Some of the stories were really quite interesting and once the book got further through history to our current design dilemmas I started to get more interested. There were multiple times I had to pause reading and write down a new idea that the book had given me and that’s really quite valuable. I hope to read this again some time. It’s okay though, we made it through and it was enjoyable.

                A remarkable read. It’s a slog at times but it’s also completely unmatched compared to any fiction that I’ve ever read. It’s a book that can only be read one way: slowly. And I had to learn that. I could only read it when I was ready to fully sit in the world and breathe Middle Earth. My favorite segments were the descriptors of how alive the world is and how every thing in the universe is listening, connected, and active. The length is insane. It’s unfortunate because I actually really want to read it again, it’s just so daunting. It actually took me like 6 months to read the full thing. I think I need to get paperback copies of the full trilogy so I can read them more effectively in chunks. But anyway, it was great and I’d absolutely read again.

                I had read this before in high school and I remembered really enjoying it. Re-reading it again now was a total treat. It’s a hilarious book. I often laughed out loud. It’s thoughtful. It has many great quotes about the fleeting nature of life. About the destructive capabilities of humanity. And it’s ultimately a pro-human, anti-war book. Really good. Can’t wait to revisit this again and get into more of Vonneguot’s work.

                Most of the good bits of this book were mentioned very early on. I feel like I would have preferred this as a long essay. Another negative part to this experience was the audiobook. The guy reading it was not my favorite. He sounded like he was from the 1950s and it created a strange snooty atmosphere to the whole thing. Good quotes & good lines that I do want to think about often. However, I wish it were more succinct and shorter.

                I really liked the disjointed storytelling and the unique, largely non-violent version of the post-apocalyptic world. The reveals and connections were really nice. The reflection of the old-world and new-world and how the characters all hold regrets regardless of their relationship to the "old world" was a fresh take that I liked. I feel like I’d like to read this again some time.

There are certain scenes I’ve been thinking a lot about lately and those lasting moments mean something. I almost feel like I need to read it again even though I just got through it. I feel like I’m still missing something. We’ll see.

Some of it was hard to understand because of its scientific complexity but despite that it was great. Really looking forward to book 2.

                I enjoyed reading about how the Fremen live on this planet. Their dew collectors, caves in the ground, their hovering orbs of light, the way they conserve water by wearing suits, sucking it out of the dead, wearing it as rings on their bodies. All incredibly cool and interesting. The hallucination scene was one of my favorites. Everything else in this book is insufferable. The politics are bland. The characters are flat.

                So inventive and engaging. This is an incredible example of a story that can only be told through comics. The landscape presentation, the varying art styles, and the complexity of the page layouts are all remarkable. I’ve never really seen anything like it. It reminds me of reading Watchmen for the first time and understanding the power of comics as a medium. The storyline itself and the writing isn’t too complicated but does have a fun sense of mystery and humor. Anyway this was an incredible recommendation from Isotope Comics in SF.

                Ultimately kind of disappointing. Most of the screenshots and art are things that I remember looking at in magazines when the games first came out. The early sketches are some of the coolest pieces but they are really only available for FFX. I think the layout design is kind of mediocre. I wish the art images were larger so you could really see all of the detail. The FFXI section feels lackluster and the FFXIV section is almost nonexistent which is really disappointing. If I knew the contents of it prior I probably would not have bought it. Anyway, something for the collection and I’ll probably poke through it from time to time. I’m rating it low because there is so much potential here for something better and more exciting.

                Ted Chiang makes me think. Always. His stories are packed to the brim with ideas both big and small. This book took me a long time to get through. Sometimes the density of the science fiction or detail is something I’m not in the mood for. When that’s the case, I find it hard to continue. I guess. I don’t always find his work as a relaxing read but I do almost always find value in anything he writes about. I was moved by The Lifecycle of Software Objects (for its detailed view of the value of digital “life” and life in general), The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling (for the technology of communication), The Great Silence (incredible quotes about communication from the perspective of a parrot, perhaps my favorite one here), Omphalos with some interesting thoughts about God & science, and finally, Anxiety Is The Dizziness of Freedom (on free will).

                I really enjoyed this. I love the symbolism all throughout and the super vivid metaphors the entire time. The surrealist nature of the book had me guessing the entire time. I loved Nakata and Hoshino’s storyline. I enjoy the character growth all throughout. It was sweet at times, perplexing at others, funny, and incredibly horny. I enjoyed pretty much all of it. I found Kafka kind of hard to relate to and I think that’s the biggest detractor to the story. I cared a little less about his path. While, I do wish there were some more conclusion, I think leaving it open to interpretation is probably much more thought provoking. I’d like to think about the whole “soul” concept a bit more.

          <p>Year of the JRPG ("Japanese Role Playing Game" for those of you not into this stuff). I love to grind. I love experience points. I love swords and magic. I love saving the world with a group of buds. Spiky hair. I love it all. Dragon Quest really reintroduced me to the genre. Its simple game mechanics taught me how JRPGs were built to be played and informed all of the other games I completed this year.<br><br>
              I need to take a break and play some shorter games before I jump into another huge JRPG but I'll absolutely be playing more DQ and FF next year. I want to complete the whole mainline series of each. I always knew I loved the genre, but I've never gone so deep before. Excited for more adventures.<br><br></p>

              Started in 2021. Fantastic. Truly beautiful. Every moment is a spectacle in the most quiet and simple of ways. I wish more games were this minimal in their concept and storytelling. The climbing mechanics are some of my favorite. Each jump feels thrilling. There are some challenging moments or encounters that feel clunky, but overall this is a truly great game. A great example of art that can only be told through this medium.

              The story is wholly complicated, but there are some really fun moments in it. It is certainly better than the ARR main storyline but often I feel as though it's too complicated. I should expect that from a Final Fantasy game, I suppose. Some of the environments are really beautiful & the combat is more of the same from the original. Good times. Looking forward to what's next. Update: Changing to 4 stars after the patch content in Heavensward. Super super fun and way better character development. Gets an extra half star.

              I can’t believe how much of a 360 I had with this game. I could easily power my way through DQ I and II. And starting this game, I tried to play it the same way. I didn’t like that the playable characters didn’t have a story like they did in II. I thought the class system was shallow. I died a few times and could not for the life of me figure out how to get my party to work. I stopped the game and really disliked it. After playing Dragon Quest XI, I learned how to play Dragon Quest games better. I revisited this game, started a new file, made a new party configuration and had an absolute blast. I felt like I played my party well, the world is a lot of fun. I explored it more thoroughly than I had just about any JRPG since I was a kid. I wrote down the areas on a note in my phone and tried to remember all of the secrets. It reminded me how much fun it is to not have quest markers and a minimap. So much more rewarding to do it yourself. The “Marchantland” arc was hilarious. <span class="spoiler-light-blue">The Ortega story actually accumulated to something which I didn’t expect even if it was short. And the teleporting to Alfheim was really surprising and a fun connection.</span> Totally changed my opinion and had a blast.

              The first half of this game contains some of my favorite moments in gaming. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. The battle system is fun. The characters are pretty memorable and colorful albeit a little shallow. The relationship between Tidus and Yuna is simple but cute. <span class="spoiler-light-blue">The whistling between the two is adorable</span>. The plot gets wildly complex toward the end and I’m not sure how I feel about it. The difficulty increases soooo much as well. The final bosses were pretty ducking intense. I wound up skipping almost all of the monster fights at the end because they were so hard. It made me feel like I was cheating but they were just way too tedious. There’s a lot of quality of life stuff that is sometimes brutal with this one. Still the mystery of the world, the overarching themes and symbols of water, spheres, religion, death are all really strong and somewhat beautiful. This game will always mean a lot to me and i’m so glad I finally beat it.

              Incredible RPG. The best take on an "old school" RPG that I've ever played. The quality of life improvements in this game are perfect. This is what every JRPG should use as the basis in 2022. The characters are all charming and useful in the party in their own ways. There's SO much content. The story has some nice twists and turns. The design is charming. The mechanics are fun. The battles are buttery smooth and quick. The care for the player is better than any other game I think I've ever played. I'd like to reference it as a UX example as much as possible. It rules.

          <p>Music is my favorite art form. No news there.<br><br>
          Because I've been in insane list-making mode this year, I started to listen to full discographies of my favorite bands. I really, really enjoyed this deep-dive approach to listening to music and it helped me fully experience a few groups like Death Cab for Cutie and Wilco---bands who I previously enjoyed but maybe didn't consider a favorite.<br><br>
        I so often listen to music while doing other things and this deep-dive approach made me realize how little I actually listen to music actively. So next year, I want to take the time to sit and just listen to music with no distraction because its a whole lot of fun.<br><br>
        I decided not to include any "records of the year". I didn't listen to a lot of stuff released in 2022 and it didn't feel relevant enough to include. Look out for it next&nbsp;year,&nbsp;though.</p>

          <p>COVID has really changed my show-going habits. But this year, as the world collectively shrugged in response to the pandemic, I started to get out again.<br><br>
            Despite there always being some sort of baseline COVID fear, I'm so glad to have live music back. Almost every show I go to makes me emotional in some kind of way and that's something that I want as often as possible. The shows I saw this year have me totally rejuvinated and believing in the power of music once again.<br><br>
            I only played two shows this year but both were wonderful. I'm looking forward to performing more again in the new year.<br><br>

              So much fun to see so many people, to play, to have Laura doing her work, to be with my friends. One of my favorite days of the year, probably.

              Babehoven was full band this time & it was great hearing the songs with a full group. I got to meet the band afterward, too. Loved the set. I was pleasantly surprised with Sadurn as well who I had never listened to before. They were wonderful.

              Got tickets absolutely last minute to this and I'm so glad I went. TA was great. I've never seen them before and it was totally worth it just to hear A More Perfect Union in all of its glory. The band looked like they were having a lot of fun and I did too. I never thought I'd be able to see them in such a small venue.

              Fun time! Really liked Forest Hills stadium. Movie Script Ending was my favorite song of the night. I had a little moment during Here's to Forever that felt special when he was singing “I want to feel the pressure of God or whatever” and it made me feel something. Overall, the set was a ton of new stuff and a lot of songs we saw in Harrisburg. I would have liked to have heard some other things but overall it was a nice night. Real Estate killed it, too.

              Such a blast with Josh. We were right up front, which I haven't done in a super long time. The set was incredible. They performed incredibly. It was pure joy on stage. You could see that they were having a blast. All of the family and homies were on stage the whole time which is the most Philly Punk thing that I could think of. Made me feel like I was ready to take action and get back into punk music. Also, the drummer brought his daughter out and we sang happy birthday for her and I cried.

              Francis Quenlin is an icon to me. I love their songwriting, voice, and stage presence. It feels incredibly genuine. I really love this band and I cried twice during their set: once when someone proposed mid-song and during Tibetan Pop Stars. Lament was a shockingly good track live. The sound was a little weird and I wish we were standing more central but overall it was great.

          <h3>Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Pretty much ever since I started making money, I've been saying that I don't buy things for myself and instead spend it all on food and drinks. Holy shit, I did not realize how true that was until looking at this final list. The list below is essentially only <i>new</i> restaurants/bars I've been to this year. So this doesn't even account for the neighborhood favorites that we go to weekly. Absolutely insane to me. There's also something to be said here about the nature of New York City. The city is full of its annoyances and complexities but you can't deny the amount of incredible food that's there. This list shows just how easy it is to go out to a new spot. Like, we didn't even try to go to this many places. It just happened.<br><br>
          I think this year established that I love Japanese food. I hadn't even had sushi until a few years ago so I'm really pleased to know how much I love it. Can't wait to experience more.<br><br>
          I have to say that seeing this list is definitely kind of eye opening. It makes me want to cook more. I'd still like to go out to new places frequently, but I can probably do it a hair less and still have quite an enjoyable time. I don't know if this is a record that I need to break!<br><br>
          <i>Note about this list: I have comments for most of these restaurants but honestly I just didn't want to copy them all over here. I've included comments for some of my favorites and if you're curious about others, let's chat next time I see ya.</i></p>

              Ordered the Scrambled Eggs with Smoked Trout and Sourdough bread. So good. Perfect amount of food. Eggs were light and trout complimented them perfectly. Sourdough was fluffy and fantastic. Limited seating but decor is so cute and cozy. Good coffee too. Couldn’t have asked for more. My favorite bakery in the city.

              Great meal and exactly what I wanted. We’ve been watching a lot of Anthony Bourdaine and I was inspired to eat some foods I don’t usually do. I had a number 2 and 6 over rice, a samosa with this amazing tangy sauce (note to self to look up the name), and we shared some other dish as well and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Exactly what I wanted on a very nice day. Went with Jevins.

              Amazing place. Could be 5 stars. We were looking for a place to go pre-gig at Union Transfer. Walled in here and had an amazing meal. Great margarita, great Chinese long beans and great lo-mein. I had a bit of what the other guys had: their skirt steaks and baby carrots. Totally slapped. A really interesting mix of Mexican and Chinese food. We went back after the show for some more drinks. It was great. Glad to know this is right next door to the bar venue in Philadelphia.

              Went with Eric Kennedy. We split something like 18 pierogi. The blood sausage, ruski, and the raspberry sweet cheese were my favorite. So tasty with great kilebasa. The real star of the show was our waitress. Incredibly friendly and helped us with all of our order. She recommended the best vodka I’ve had in my life: Zubrowka. I want to just sip it straight. We had a blast. Perfect spot for hanging out but I 100% over-ate.

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So, here we are. We made it. About 10 hours left in the year and this is done. Phew.<br><br>
          I'm so proud of myself for being so attentive to my thought this year. I'm proud of myself for taking the time to treat it as something a little special.<br><br>
          What's wild to me is that these lists don't even account for all of the things I created or did this year. I had a great year at my day job---my first year as a product manager. I taught a college class. I made some really fun things as a freelancer. I started running and lost ten pounds. I started drinking way less. I played a lot of music with my friends. I travelled a little bit. I cooked more than I ever have. And ultimately, I pushed myself and listened to myself more than ever. I journaled almost every single day. I wrote poetry. Yeah. I feel good. It often feels fleeting, but for now---I feel good.<br><br>
          I turn 30 in 4 days. This feels like a good start. Happy New Year and I'll catch you soon.<br><br>
          Oh, one last thing: make your own website. It's fun.
