          <h3>Hello</h3>
            <p>2024 was an incredibly strange year for me. I experienced some new health problems. My family experienced death. However, I can't say the year was bad. It was full of positivity and I feel like I have a new sense of my self after it all.<br><br>
            That being said, this list felt like it wasn't as important for me to make this year. I started working on this project two years ago as a way to learn more about my interests. I wanted to know who I was as an adult. What things did I enjoy doing? What things did I not enjoy? This year, I felt like I arrived to whatever destination I was hoping to get to. I know those things now. And ultimately, I don't really feel like talking about it yet. I've had my head down working on more intentional projects than this one. And when those are complete, that's what I <i>really</i> want you to see.<br><br>
            I also want to show you more things about my life that aren't easily quantifiable and shared quickly in a list. I want to show you some new pants I bought this year that make me really happy. I want you to see the stitching. I want you to hear music that I've been working on: there's a lot of it. I want you to read my poetry: there's a lot of that too. I want to show you my entire record collection.<br><br>
            I'm toying with the idea of starting a blog to show you all of these things and to better show the information in these lists as well. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to do all of the work, doing a little bit every month sounds very appealing. We'll see.<br><br>
            My ultimate goal is to show you less of what I've consumed and show you more of what I've made. And this year, I think we see signs of that in the data. My consumption of TV, Movies, Books, Food, is all lower than it's ever been. And I think that's because I've been using my time to write music, make art, and work on little projects. That's a good sign.<br><br>
            I've still collected a ton of information, but I've written a lot less this year. And I don't care to reflect on it as much as I have in the past.<br><br>
            Here's the quick summary: I absolutely had a brat summer. I had a Beatles year after that. Please watch Alfonso Cuaron movies. Seinfeld is now hilarious to me. RPG video games are the best & I still haven't completed one in a whole year.<br><br> 
            I hope you're doing well and I'll talk to you soon, alright?</p>
