# Listrak Email Customer Experience Training


## Goal of this exercise/training:
To understand how our emails impact a human at the end of the inbox. What does it look like? Can there be improvement made? What is a poor experience? How do Listrak automated solutions tie into these experiences and journies? How do our solutions work together to help a customer acheive their goals? How can we as designers consider those goals and motivations when we make emails?

## Considerations
Before we can start, we need to understand who our customers are. We serve a lot of different customers that are trying to sell different things. And then there are even different types of shoppers. So we need to create detailed user personas and scenarios to understand how their journey can differ.

I've based the scenarios based on

So, I'm thinking we need to start with Audiences:
1. New Customer.
    This is someone who is a prospective buyer. They might be looking for something to buy, or may have an idea for a project that they want to accomplish. What do we want to consider the first touch point? Anything that gets the customer onto the welcome series probably. But it's also possible that someone starts off with a BA message before they actually decide to subscribe. Let's abandon the audiences for now and just think through a few scenarios.

!!! We may want to consider by vertical as well since the cadence of buying products can be very different for different people. Like, someone might buy clothes every few months, but someone who buys a couch probably wont be buying another one for a very long time. So how do you keep that person engaged? Also, what is actually backed by research compared to my personal opinion? Because for me, I'd probably say that once the person purchases... just let them go. Make your buying experience and clean and simple as possible and they might come back in the future when they move in a few years.

Okay, so I'm a person who just moved into a new apartment and I'm looking for some new furniture to fill my living room. I'm going to go take a look at a few websites that I've heard of before or have had friends recommend things to me. Previous experience and personal recommendation always is a more-likely place to start off a shopping experience. (Can I find a source for this? Is it bad to write up a thing and then to go and look for a source that actually finds it to be true?)

## Sources/Helpful Links

###  Need-based Shopper:
This is a person who doesn't want to make the wrong decision. Harder to upsell. Need a strong emotional connection to purchase. They are less likely to believe that you can help solve their problem. Value add marketing may be helpful in building trust.

Looking to buy a desk because they just moved into a new home.
- Goal: To buy a new desk for my home office.
- I know of a few things I want, color, general size, but don't know where I'm going to buy it from.
- A friend of mine recommended me a new desk from this cool website that he bought one from. I'm going to go check it out.
- - (Most people go to a source based on a friend's recommedation)
- The desks are really expensive, so i'm going to spend a lot of time making sure that it's the right one.
    - I have this one as my first choice because my friend recommended it.
    - I ask other friends who might have something similar for their opinion.
    - I do some research into the the benefits of desks like this.
    - I think about how it might look in my room and if I need to buy anything additional. Will it fit in my space? Will it look the way I want it to? Is this the best option for me?
    - I see that there's a popup offering 5% off my first order. I'm going to sign up to get that offer.
    - I wait a few minutes and decide to leave my options up for a few days. I need to look into this further before I continue.
    - I get a browse abandonment message a day later saying that I should come on back and take a look. I ignore the email.
    - I receive another email two days later giving me advice on why I should choose their product. This is welcome series #2.
    - I decide to use the coupon that I got a few days ago because I see that it's going to expire soon and I DO want this desk, I just need to come to terms with spending money and my waiting a few days confirmed that this is the one that I actually want.
    - I add the desk to my cart and complete the purchase.
    - I get an order confirmation transactional message confirming my purchase. All looks good and I'm happy I can review this and leave it in my inbox incase as a digital receipt, in case anything weird comes up. I also see that my coupon was used and I'm happy I saved a little bit of money along the way.
    - I receive another welcome series message a day later while I'm waiting for my desk to come and it gives me some other products I might like. I'm excited for it to arrive but am unsure if I really want anything else yet.
    - I receive a marketing message for some new product that just came out. I'm kind of uninterested because I'm still waiting for me desk to arrive.
    - I receive a shipping confirmation transactional email
    - It arrives by mail a week later, I set it up, I'm very happy with the quality and I feel good about my purchase.
    - I start to consider how I may now need to sell my old desk and what other pieces I want in the room to go around it.
    - I've already browsed the desk company's website and I'm not sure if there's anything else that I want to get from them.
    - I got back on the website to look at some of their accessories like a shelf that might fit neatly under the desk for some extra storage. I take a look at a few places and decide I need to do some research again.
    - I get a review request email asking me to review my new desk. I don't really feel like writing a review right now because I'm really busy, so I ignore the email. Do reviews on websites actually do much at all anyway? It feels like so many of them are fake these days.

    Things to consider for this type of shopper:
    - There are a lot of potential touch points for someone who is spending a lot of time on your website.
    - You may want to make sure they aren't receiving too many emails with similar content
    - Each should probably look a little different to indicate that they a different emails.
    - They should focus on getting the customer informed and back to the site.

    Some new things to try:
    - A product browse with specific product information so that they can learn more about it.
    - Might not want to send a browse/abandonment message until they are fully through the welcome series.
    - Marketing messages might not be relevant to those customers just yet because they are currently focused in a different path and are already interacting with special parts of your site.
    - - It'd be helpful if we can limit sending marketing messages if someone is currently in a Abandonment thread or something like that. THe intent is to get someone to purchase for most normal marketing emails, abandonment emails, etc. 
   

   Okay, I like the scenario above. What if we look at it in terms of the 5 types of online shoppers from [this article] (https://blog.smile.io/5-types-online-shoppers/). It seems like a good place to start.

   
   Wandering Customers
   Impulse Buyers
  

So here's the thing. I don't think there's any one path to getting a customer to purchase, so we need to look at it from a few different scenarios. And these scenarios should be different enough to encapsule our Listrak solutions.

Should post purchase, or welcome content try to cater to a bunch of different people? Probably. There should probably be multiple paths that we should be thinking about because there are a lot of different types of shoppers.

### Loyal Customer
Let's Look at it from the perspective of a Loyal Customer:
This is someone who has purchased a number of times before. At this point, they trust the brand. They aren't always looking for an exact item, but there are a few regulars that they re-purchase every few months.

- I see an ad on social media that a new product is coming out. It's some new face wash that I think would be really interesting to try.
- It's not in stock yet, but I know it's going to be a pretty limited release, so I sign up for an alert on the website. This way I know when the new thing is going to be out.
- I just remembered that I'm pretty low on my normal routine care products, so I navigate to the products that I need and purchase.
- I see that I can get 10 loyalty points for this purchase, which gets me really close to my next reward. I might be able to use my reward points on the new product when it comes out, so I'm pretty excited about that.

### Discount Seekers
This person probably already knows what they want to buy but are waiting for the best deal to do so.
- They surf around amazon and see what the price is for an equvalent product.
- They go to the main manufacturer to see if there are good choices there.
- They see a popup and decide to try and get a discount there.
- They're satisfied with this and purhcase.
