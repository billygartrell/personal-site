Thesis: Growing up in the country came with a fear of the city.
Personal memory: Going to Philly, being afraid of people on the sidewalk
Personal memory: Woman and son who were afraid to be in downtown Lancaster
Personal memory: James Barrett texting me, "Is the area I'm in okay?"

While cities do have a higher crime rate, I've found that they aren't anything to be afraid of. It's a weird mental hurdle to overcome. Probably deeply rooted in racism as well because that's where darkskinned people live. Examples: There are recent examples of Fox News saying how unchained all cities are right now.
