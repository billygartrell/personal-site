I’ve got my first Jekyll post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to re-create a blog for a few years now. Back in 2017, I had written in my blog every day, sharing some creative thing that I had completed that day. Daily posts became a little bit too challenging to maintain over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I do love the idea of owning my own little piece of the internet that is full of my thoughts and things that I love– an archive of who I am over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today has been a lot of exploring what Jekyll offers and learning how to edit the pages. I’ve never used a static blog generator like this before, so it’s taking some time to understand, but I’m pleased that it’s up and running.ç&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Wow, very exciting.
