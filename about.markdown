Hi there, I'm Billy, a multi-disciplinary graphic designer and musician. I'm originally from the forests of Pennsylvania and now live in the Big Ol' City of New York.

In a past life, I managed creative marketing campaigns for retailers across the globe and spent many-a-night playing music in basements and living rooms of the American Northeast.
