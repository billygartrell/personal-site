  {number: "1", title: "Good, Thanks", genre: "Cafe", star:"4.0", comment: "First time here. The decor is way nicer than Concord Hill, the place that used to be in this same building. Cool marble tables, a nice little booth. It was cool. I got the Hashbrown plate that came with two pieces of toasted sourdough bread, two eggs, a little nice and salty hashborwn patty, an arugula salad with pickled onions, and a spread of whitefish salad that was the perfect level of fishy/salty for me. Definitely good. I’d go back and try out their dinner or other stuff on the breakfast menu."},
  {number: "2", title: "Ippudo's Hells Kitchen", genre: "Japanese", star:"3.5", comment: "Ramen spot that was nice. Their broth had yuzu in it and that citrus-y addition was really cool. I love yuzu. Their pork bun was just okay but their spicy tuna roll was great. Much spicier than average and wrapped in super dense rice. I really enjoyed it. We got some octopus balls that were pretty good too. Ultimately, good food. Our table was literally one inch away from the couple next to us so it was kind of like we were sitting on top of another conversation so it loses some points for that. I would have preferred a little more room and our own spot. Would go back though!"},
  {number: "3", title: "Farmhouse Eatery", genre: "Cafe", star:"3.0", comment: "We stopped into their smaller cafe location at the end of last year and we got some to-go coffees. We really liked it! So we popped into the more-official Eatery while in Stroudsburg and it was just okay. The decor inside is absolutely wildly tacky and the food was mid. We had an eggs Benedict and very weird Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was grilled which I did not expect and also absolutely smothered in gravy. I guess I prefer chicken and waffles to be a little bit sweeter. Anyway, it was just kind of weird overall. I'd definitely go back to their other location but not in love with this one."},
  {number: "4", title: "pán", genre: "Italian", star:"4.0", comment: "Location is so cool. Half indoor/outdoor warehouse but very cozy. The pizzas were some incredibly solid gourmet style pizza: the potato, truffle, andddddd the hot mess with prosciutto were great. The gnocchi that we split, and the salads were just okay. The cocktails (extra dirty martinis) were fantastic. Our server was incredibly kind and gave us free Tiramisu because we had some long waits. I didn’t mind the wait at all and was having so much fun hanging out with Claire, Jevins, Elanna, and Shawn. I had a nice little espresso in a hand-made cup too. The place has a ton of charm and I really enjoyed it. I’d love to go back especially for pizza and drinks."},
  {number: "5", title: "Odd Fox", genre: "Cafe", star:"4.0", comment: "I really like this little unassuming coffee shop. I had a mocha that was great and there was a good indie playlist on. Feels like a shop from 2010 or something and I love it for that. Great spot. They serve Parlor coffee too which I really enjoy."},
  {number: "6", title: "babacool", genre: "Cafe", star:"3.5", comment: "Food was really good but I thought their cocktails were really unmemorable. Ricotta was wonderful. Server was nice but made a few mistakes. I liked him though. Cute spot. Nothing too wild."},
  {number: "7", title: "Wanpaku", genre: "Japanese", star:"4.5", comment: "So good. I went on a little date here by myself. I had a pork bun, their curry with pork, and a beer. It was honestly perfect for what I wanted. I’d love to go back here soon and try more of their dishes. I loved it."},
  {number: "8", title: "Sweetleaf Coffee", genre: "Cafe", star:"3.0", comment: "It was pretty busy in here which was a bummer. I like the eclectic furniture in here though. I’d like to come back and try it again sometime. I will say that there was this little moment where the sun happened to shine right on our table and it was quite beautiful."},
  {number: "9", title: "Oxocomoco", genre: "Mexican", star:"4.0", comment: "So cool. Everything here was presented so well and it all tasted so good. Unfortunately, I was feeling pretty depressed this day and it definitely affected how I was feeling here. So, it was good and I definitely want to go back. But that’s as good as I could give it right now."},
  {number: "10", title: "Ososweet", genre: "Cafe", star:"4.0", comment: "This cute little spot in Chadd’s Ford was lovely. Their scones are some of the best I’ve probably ever had. Their bagel sandwich was decent. Okay bagel but with a good chipotle mayo sauce. Solid coffee. A great breakfast and cute little place near Eric’s and Sarah’s that I’ll definitely try to go back to when I’m around."},
  {number: "11", title: "Smør", genre: "Nordic", star:"4.0", comment: "One of my first times eating Scandinavian food in the city. I really enjoyed it. We started with cocktails (I got a spicy cucumber drink) and a plate of sampler. The salmon was great but a flavor I’d had many times in my life. The Chicken Salad wasn’t anything too extraordinary, but the Halibut sample was my favorite bite of the night. It felt the most uniquely tasty. We ordered schnitzel and Swedish meatballs for our mains. Both were tasty but by the end I was outrageously full. I preferred the schnitzel and the sour-creamy sauce that came with it."},
  {number: "12", title: "Cool World", genre: "Brasserie", star:"2.5", comment: "Standard cocktail bar but a little more expensive. I guess they’re more of a wine bar? Anyway, I didn’t really need to go here. Maybe I’ll stop in sometime and try a glass of wine instead."},
  {number: "13", title: "Sunday In Brooklyn", genre: "Brasserie", star:"4.5", comment: "Incredible brunch. And I hate brunch. Their “Long Island style” hash browns were spiced very nicely. The hazelnut pancakes were remarkable, unlike anything I’ve ever had before. And the tuna sourdough thing that I got was super light and tasty. Parlor coffee. One of the best breakfasts I’ve had in a long time. It was pretty packed. That’s one of the only things I’m taking points off for. We were all crammed in together."},
  {number: "14", title: "La Pecora Bianca", genre: "Italian", star:"4.0", comment: "We stopped in here prior to the showing of Leopoldstadt in Manhattan. I don't know any restaurants in this part of the city, so I'm glad that Laura recommended this. It was good. Gluten free, handmade pasta. I couldn't tell that it was gluten free. It was very good. We had some pretty delicious negronis as well. I ordered the Garganelli. Wild musrooms with pesto and garlic. Really simple, but it tasted great. The tiramisu dessert that we got was mid as hell. Additionally, as Laura and I were sitting around, we were commenting on the interior design. It looked really nice and modern. However, we spotted that there were stacks of books that had absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant around. Just random, vintage books that looked 'cool' on a shelf with zero relevance. I dislike that and I take a point away for being hollow. I'll do it."},
  {number: "15", title: "Augur’s Well", genre: "Bar", star:"3.5", comment: "Cool beer bar in Manhattan. Surprisingly good bar food, friendly staff, and mellow atmosphere. Pretty empty for a Thursday night, and I always enjoy that. Pretty amazing selection of craft beers from all over. It's all pretty expensive, but I guess that's to be expected from Manhattan. If everything was a few bucks cheaper, I'd be here often."},
  {number: "16", title: "The Hard Swallow", genre: "Bar", star:"3.0", comment: "Pretty funny bar full of ridiculous and tacky rock and roll memoribilia. They played Rammstein over the speakers and were playing Underworld, that movie from the 2000s starring Kate Beckinsale (sp?). Had a whisky ginger. Good to know there's another hole in the wall like this nearby."},
  {number: "17", title: "Kingston Standard Brewery", genre: "Brewery", star:"3.5", comment: "Pretty standard brewery vibes, but we had some great pizza and oysters. Really nice little spot that I'd love to go back to and try more beer. The one I had was decent. Nothing too wild."},
  {number: "18", title: "Ship to Shore", genre: "American", star:"3.5", comment: "After having a tough time finding a place for dinner, we found this little pub-style spot on the Hudson River part of Kingston. It was pretty solid! I had a tuna steak over salad with sweet potatos. The tuna was quite tasty. I’ve never been able to get a steak as good as the one look made for me once about three years ago. Everything was much more expensive than we anticipated. The interior didn’t really seem like a place with $30+ plates. So, it was a bit too expensive to have a sportsbar tv playing over the bar in my opinion. I’d eat the tuna steak again though."},
  {number: "19", title: "West Kill Supply", genre: "Brewery", star:"4.5", comment: "Very good brewery. I only had half-pours, but what I did have was unique and super tasty. I’ve never had anything like their Juniper beer before. I had a good hazy IPA and a little bit of a darker beer. Both were nice. I chatted with Cory and had some good conversation. Our bartenders were nice. The taxidermy was weird, but good. There were some dogs hanging out inside who were very sweet. And they had some popup where I had a grilled cheese with a tomato, peach jam on it and it was delish. I had a great time. My favorite spot from our little Kingston trip for Eric’s bachelor party."},
  {number: "20", title: "Smoky Rock BBQ", genre: "BBQ", star:"3.5", comment: "BBQ perhaps isn't my favorite of cuisines. I really like it, don't get me wrong. But it's a type of food where I feel like it all kind of tastes the same. For the amount that we paid, I was hoping that we would get some more food. It was quite expensive, but I think that's just a thing when you're getting a ton of BBQ food. Anyway, all of the meats were great: brisket end, chicken, and pulled port. It came with a flatbread that I really liked, some great mac and cheese, and a great blueberry house sauce. I think the sauces were all too watery for my liking. It was good, I just feel mixed about it. The decor was kind of weird inside too. Good."},
  {number: "21", title: "Broadway Lights Diner", genre: "Diner", star:"4.5", comment: "A really great diner. The interior and exterior are classic shiny-chrome. A great sign out front. The food was great (just classic eggs, toast, and hash browns), our waitress was incredibly nice, and the service was quick. For a Sunday morning, it was perfect. A great diner that was still cheap, and easy to be in."},

  {number: "23", title: "Roman’s", genre: "Italian", star:"4.5", comment: "We had a pretty incredible breakfast here. Man, unfortunately I am tardy with writing this review and what we ordered wasn’t even on the menu anymore. But it was all delicious and unexpected. I don’t think I’ve had anything quite like some of the dishes. Plus, Sea Wolf bread is probably my favorite in the city at the moment."},
  {number: "24", title: "Fan Fan Donuts", genre: "Donuts", star:"2.5", comment: "These were pretty good. I thought both that we tried had a weird aftertaste that kind of tasted like plastic? Not sure how to describe it. I like the idea of their flavor combos and the icings were good. But idk, I didn’t love it. Open to trying it again, though."},
  {number: "25", title: "Manhattan Triple Decker", genre: "Diner", star:"3.5", comment: "Okay so I’ve been here before but recently it has changed a bit due to new ownership. It was good. I got a triple decker turkey sandwich with curly fries. And honestly, it was all still pretty reasonably priced. The menu was large, the design was cute. The worst part about it is that now everyone who was there was a younger person. It used to be a regular diner with older people hanging out and grabbing food. Younger kids. Like a proper diner that’s for everyone. Some kind was posing for photos at the bar, all of the servers were cool 20 something’s and I didn’t see anyone who looked “uncool”. Idk I kind of hate that."},
  {number: "26", title: "bluEmber", genre: "American", star: "4.0", comment: "This was the restaurant at the Palm Springs resort where we stayed for Eric and Allie’s wedding. The food was pretty damn good. We had Brussels sprouts, truffle fries, a salad, chips and guacamole, and a fantastic salmon sandwich that was kind of like a lobster roll in its presentation. Everything was quite expensive, but at least it was worth it every time we ate there over the weekend!"},
  {number: "27", title: "Palms Cafe", genre: "Cafe", star: "3.0", comment: "Idk if I should even review this to be honest. Some quick coffee at the resort. What I had was just okay. Pastries were big and good though."},

Note to self: do not get fried animal style in the future just do it in the burger. I actually thought the burger was awesome but the fries were too much. Didn’t love them. For fast food though, it’s still pretty high on my list."},
  {number: "29", title: "Ritual Coffee - Palm Springs", genre: "Cafe", star: "4.5", comment: "Dude, this place was quite good. Their cold brew was really bitter and reminded me of Variety. I thought it was super tasty and we happened to hit it at just the right time of a very hot day. In that moment, the coffee was perfect. We hung out outside in the shade and had a nice time. Most points are just because I had a nice day. I’d like to go back or try another location."},
  {number: "30", title: "Las Palmas Brewery", genre: "Brewery", star: "4.0", comment: "Really cool and mellow spot in Palm Springs. I had the Table Beer and enjoyed it. Their branding is rad and our server was nice as well. A cool aesthetic spot with reasonably priced brews. Really enjoyed it."},
  {number: "31", title: "Tac/Aquila", genre: "Mexican", star: "4.5", comment: "Perhaps it’s the margaritas talking but this place was fucking good. We got a margarita sampler, which were all quite delicious. The best pineapple margarita I’ve ever had. Their carne asade taco was rivaled by stuff I’ve had here but the others were fantastic. We got a fish one that was great and a massive tuna taco that was unlike anything I’ve had before too. So pleasantly surprised with this place."},

  {number: "37", title: "Fin du Monde", genre: "French/American", star: "4.5", comment: "Little French place right down the road. I was honestly really pleased with everything we ate. Got some wine, a steak, and something else that I forget now (I’m writing this two months later). But the experience was really nice. If it was a few dollars cheaper I’d go there much more frequently. Unfortunately it’s quite expensive but it was very good. Really enjoyable."},

They only had a few products to try, but they were all wonderfully tasty and the cocktails were especially fantastic and unique. The bartender was a guy who lived in Greenpoint previously. We had some nice conversation and he was super kind to our group. The interior design of the space was one of the coolest I've ever seen for the 'warehouse as a bar' type of spot. It was so beautifully built directly into their warehouse with varying textures (wood, tile, etc.). Totally beautiful. Chill vibes. Fantastic drinks. My favorite place during this weekend."},

We were in a greenhouse type of structure on top of the roof of a hotel. It felt like they were trying to be really high-end and swanky but I don't think they pulled it off at all. It was a cold day and the space was not properly heated. There were also so many people in the space that it felt cramped. It was loud due to all of the voices bouncing around the greenhouse and we could barely hear each other even at our own table. It was really overwhelming and kind of a shit time. However, it makes up in stars because I got a tuna fillet and I actually really liked it so... there's that."},

Got mucky toast which was rich but delightful, gnocci with fresh peas, beans, and a delicious a sauce. Haddock with mashed potatoes was another perfect dish. Sticky toffee pudding, glass of port, Cotswold crème, honeysuckle dacquari, cask beer, for a perfect British food evening. Full English breakfast in the morning. Black pudding."},

I had half a beer and we got back on the road."},

But it was good. Honestly, the best part about this place was the staff. They were all so friendly. First lunch I had some baba ghanoush, which I really enjoyed. We went here for dinner and had some plates of things that I don’t remember but I do remember it being nice. For breakfast (which was free with our stay) we had some really nice French toast with homemade preserves on top, scrambled eggs, sourdough, etc. It was good."},

It tasted nice but it would have been nicer if they had a little bit more. I spent some time journaling here while Laura did some shopping. I had a nice time outside."},
  {number: "107", title: "St. John Restaurant", genre: "", star: "3.5", comment: "This one is really strange to review. Laura and I both felt like we ordered the wrong things. Primarily, because a lot of their offerings are harder to find meat products: bone marrow, tripe, pig’s head, etc. Lots of things we’ve never had before. So, we weren’t really sure what to get. We were struggling with our order and were hoping that the waiter would assist us a little bit in our decisions, but they simply said, ‘our menu changes twice a days so there aren’t really any popular dishes.’ So, we ordered some bone marrow, which was great, hake with lentils, which was pretty good, and some other things. I don’t even remember. I will say that their desserts were good. Madelines, homemade fig leaf ice cream, and some sticky-pudding-like-thing. It was good. The bone marrow was good. But overall, I think we just felt uncomfortable because we weren’t sure what to get and ultimately made some poor choices. A bummer of a time. We want to go back and try it again."},

The aesthetic was really cool and the food was good, but the star of the show was our server. She gave us a ton of free shots of soju/sake. She was adorable and very sweet. Made the whole experience very fun. Every dish we had was good. The desert was this little flan like think that you could draw on top of before eating. It was really cool. Wonderful spot. Pricey, but it was good."},
